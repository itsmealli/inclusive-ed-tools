## A. Faculty Implementation Guide

**Purpose:** Practical guidance for implementing Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Socially Just Disability Resources (SJDR) within inclusive adult/workforce contexts.

### A.1 UDL in Practice

UDL plans for learner variability *from the start*.

- **Engagement:** connect lessons to authentic, emotionally resonant workplace dilemmas.  
- **Representation:** present content via visuals, discussion, video, and text.  
- **Expression:** allow multiple demonstration modes (oral, digital, performance).

**Try this:** Ask, “How will students *see*, *hear*, and *do* this skill in multiple ways?”

### A.2 Andragogy & Adult Learning

Honor adult autonomy and experience.

- Start with a **problem to solve** rather than content to memorize.  
- Leverage learners’ **prior experience** as expertise.  
- Emphasize **immediate workplace relevance** and flexible pathways.

### A.3 UDL + SJDR Alignment

- **UDL** anticipates barriers.  
- **SJDR** affirms identity and agency.  

Use community cultural wealth by inviting learners’ workplace examples from their communities and cultures.

### A.4 Designing Instruction

**Scaffolded Instruction Sequence (Gradual Release)**

| Stage   | Faculty Role                              | Learner Role                     |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Model   | Demonstrate the task; think aloud.        | Observe and note steps.          |
| Guide   | Offer prompts, templates, feedback.       | Practice using supports.         |
| Release | Fade scaffolds for independence.          | Apply skills independently.      |

**Trauma‑Informed & Culturally Responsive Moves**

- Establish psychological safety and co‑create agreements.  
- Offer opt‑outs for sensitive role‑plays.  
- Normalize reflection and repair over correction.  
- Use culturally grounded examples of communication and teamwork.

### A.5 Dual-Mode Delivery

- **In‑person:** tactile, peer‑interactive tasks.  
- **Online:** captioned videos, accessible docs, discussion boards.  
- **Hybrid:** synchronous modeling + asynchronous reflection.

**Accessibility checks:** captions, alt‑text, contrast, keyboard navigation.

### A.6 Reflection & Continuous Improvement

- After each module, ask: *Which strategies produced the strongest engagement? What equity gaps remain?*  
- Schedule time to iterate using student feedback and artifacts.

## A‑1. Faculty Implementation Checklist

**Use:** before instruction (planning) and after delivery (reflection).

### Planning for Accessibility & Inclusion

- **Accessibility:** what worked (captions, alt‑text, translations)? barriers?  
- **Agency:** where was learner choice evident? what can fade?  
- **Cultural Responsiveness:** whose experiences were represented or missing?  
- **Trauma‑Informed:** how was safety/predictability established?  
- **Evidence & Next Step:** artifacts to keep; one change to test next session.
