# **Toolkit Overview**

## **Universal Design for Learning Lesson Planning Resources for Inclusive Workforce Education**

### **Applied Framework Derived from Chapter 5 Findings**** **

The following five instructional modules, Professional Communication, Time Management and Task Completion, Teamwork and Conflict Resolution, Self-Advocacy and Goal Setting, and Adaptability and Problem-Solving, collectively comprise the instructional toolkit developed from this study. The toolkit extends the research findings presented in Chapter 5 by translating the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Socially Just Disability Resources (SJDR) into practical, replicable lesson templates for use in inclusive adult and workforce-preparation settings.

The toolkit contextualizes soft-skills instruction and bridges the gap between course content and applied workforce readiness. It is designed to allow instructors to integrate these lessons into any course with minimal modification, providing ready-to-use, evidence-based activities that align academic instruction with real-world employability skills.

Each module operationalizes the study’s central premise that equitable instruction requires proactive design. The templates demonstrate how UDL’s three principles multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression can be integrated with SJDR to foster learner agency, persistence, and workplace readiness among adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Together, these modules illustrate how inclusive design and workforce alignment can be embedded systematically in instructional practice.

The toolkit is intended for use by faculty, counselors, and educational coaches across noncredit, credit, hybrid, and community-based programs.

Each module includes the following components:

- **Scenario-based learning activities** that reflect authentic workplace contexts and emphasize problem solving and emotional regulation.
- **Scaffolded instruction** that gradually releases responsibility to promote independence and confidence.
- **Multimodal instructional materials** designed for accessibility and cultural responsiveness.
- **Reflection and assessment tools** that support self-regulation, goal setting, and continuous improvement.
- **Faculty implementation notes** that highlight trauma-informed, culturally sustaining, and equity-centered practices.
While the modules may be implemented individually, they are designed to function as an integrated framework addressing key “durable” employability skills: communication, organization, collaboration, self-advocacy, and adaptability. Collectively, the toolkit supports statewide goals for equitable workforce and economic development consistent with the California Community Colleges’ *Vision 2030* framework (CCCCO, 2025). This appendix presents the toolkit as the applied outcome of the study, illustrating how research on UDL and SJDR can inform the design of equitable adult education and workforce programs. The following sections present complete lesson templates that faculty may adapt for local contexts while maintaining fidelity to the study’s guiding principles and findings.**

# **Appendix A**

## **Faculty Implementation Guide**

**Purpose**

This guide supports instructors in implementing *Universal Design for Learning (UDL)* and *Socially Just Disability Resources (SJDR)* within Career Development and College Preparation (CDCP) and College-to-Career (C2C) courses. It translates Chapter 5 recommendations into actionable teaching strategies that advance workforce readiness and equity.

Faculty may reference this guide when designing new modules or use it each term as a fidelity check for existing lessons.

**Section 1. Foundations for Inclusive Teaching**

***1.1 UDL in Practice***

UDL invites instructors to plan for learner variability from the outset rather than retrofit accommodations.

- Engagement: Present authentic, emotionally resonant workplace dilemmas to connect learning to relevance and belonging (Flanagan et al., 2022).
- Representation: Offer information through visuals, discussion, video, and text, using multimodal templates that model accessibility across media.
- Expression: Provide varied demonstration modes; oral, digital, or performance, to capture mastery.
**Try This**: When planning, ask “How will students *see*, *hear*, and *do* this skill in multiple ways?”

***1.2 Andragogy & Adult Learning***

To honor adult learners’ autonomy, instructors can integrate the following design habits (Knowles, 1984; Leif et al., 2023):

- Begin with a *problem to solve* rather than content to memorize.
- Leverage learners’ prior experience as expertise.
- Emphasize immediate workplace relevance.
- Allow flexibility for learners balancing work, study, and family obligations (Fensie, 2023).
***1.3 UDL + SJDR Alignment***

UDL anticipates barriers; SJDR affirms identity. Instructors can operationalize this alignment by designing lessons that anticipate barriers (UDL) while affirming learner identities and agency (SJDR). 
Drawing on Yosso’s (2005) *community cultural wealth*, modules center learners’ lived experiences as assets.
*For example, invite students to contribute workplace examples from their cultural or community contexts when introducing new skills.*

**Reflect**: How do my examples reflect cultural and linguistic diversity? Whose experiences are missing?

**Section 2. Designing Instruction**

***2.1 Scaffolding for Autonomy***

Begin with high support (worked examples, sentence stems, checklists) and intentionally fade toward independence (Flanagan et al., 2022).

**Table A **

*Scaffolded Instruction Sequence: Faculty and Learner Roles*

| Stage | Faculty Role | Learner Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model | Demonstrate the task; think aloud. | Observe and note steps. |
| Guide | Offer prompts, templates, and feedback. | Practice using scaffolds. |
| Release | Remove supports gradually. | Apply skills independently. |

*Note: This table illustrates the gradual-release model (Model → Guide → Release) as applied in UDL-aligned instruction for adult learners.*

***2.2 Trauma-Informed & Culturally Responsive Strategies***

Facilitators should begin each module by reviewing community agreements, affirming learner voice, and framing mistakes as opportunities for growth. These strategies reduce anxiety and promote a sense of belonging, which research shows improves persistence for adult learners with IDD.

- Establish psychological safety (“We learn by trying.”).
- Provide opt-out options for sensitive role-plays.
- Normalize reflection and repair over correction.
- Use culturally grounded examples of communication and teamwork (Westerlin & Folske-Starlin, 2024).
***Tip****: Incorporate storytelling from diverse mentors or alumni to illustrate workplace norms across cultures.*

***2.3 Dual-Mode Delivery***

Modules are designed for delivery both in-person and online (dual-mode).

- In-person: emphasize tactile, peer-interactive tasks.
- Online: embed captioned video, discussion boards, and adaptive pacing.
- Hybrid: pair synchronous modeling with asynchronous reflection.
Accessibility Check: Confirm captioning, screen-reader compatibility (no emoticons), alt-text for visuals, and high-contrast color schemes.

**Section 3. Implementation & Reflection**

***3.1 Faculty Reflection Checklist***

Faculty may use the Reflection Checklist (Appendix D) at the end of each module to evaluate inclusion, learner engagement, and UDL fidelity.
**Prompts include:**

- How did learners demonstrate agency today?
- Which scaffolds supported the most engagement? Which should fade sooner?
- How did today’s activity promote learner choice and voice?
- Whose voices or experiences were centered or overlooked in today’s activity?
***3.2 Communities of Practice***

Instructors are encouraged to collaborate in professional learning communities to share adaptations, build consistency, and ensure equitable implementation across programs. Peer observation and co-design promote collective efficacy and reduce faculty isolation.

**Section 4. Vision 2030 Alignment**

In alignment with Vision 2030’s priorities of access, equity, and workforce mobility, this toolkit supports institutional goals by (CCCCO, 2025):

- Embedding stackable micro-credentials that validate transferable soft skills (e.g., *Effective Communicator*, *Adaptive Problem Solver*).
- Strengthening career mobility through equitable, flexible learning pathways.
- Encouraging lifelong learning via reflection and continuous improvement cycles.
Faculty participation in these practices contributes to institutional metrics for equity, retention, and workforce preparation identified in Vision 2030 (CCCCO, 2025).
**Visual Idea**: Institutions may use a three-column table (Goal | Instructional Strategy | Faculty Action) to demonstrate alignment during program review.

**Section 5. Continuous Improvement**

***Reflect & Refine:***

- Which instructional strategies produced the strongest learner persistence?
- How did I document UDL fidelity across modalities?
- What equity gaps remain visible, and what institutional supports could address them?
At the end of each term, schedule a 30-minute reflection using student feedback to adjust one activity for improved inclusion. UDL and SJDR are iterative frameworks; faculty are encouraged to revisit module design after each term, using outcome data and reflections to improve inclusion and effectiveness.

**Optional Resources**

- Quick-Start Checklist: *Top 10 Inclusive Teaching Moves* (one-page summary for easy reference).
- Evidence Collection Ideas: Collect learner reflections, micro-credential completions, or accessibility-audit notes to document impact.
**Summary**

This guide operationalizes inclusive pedagogy through concrete steps faculty can use immediately. It merges *theory* (UDL, SJDR, andragogy) with *practice* (lesson templates, reflection checklists, and faculty collaboration), ensuring that workforce-readiness education for adult learners with IDD is equitable, scalable, and directly aligned with the recommendations presented in Chapter 5 of this dissertation.

## **Professional Communication Module****: Toolkit Lesson Template - UDL Aligned**

**Introduction to the Module**

The Professional Communication module equips adult learners with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) to build verbal, nonverbal, and digital communication skills that foster confidence and success in inclusive employment. Employers consistently identify clear communication, teamwork, and customer interaction as top workforce competencies (Williams et al., 2023). Yet adults with IDD may experience barriers such as processing delays, limited workplace communication experience, or anxiety during social exchanges (Burke et al., 2021).

This module integrates Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles, Socially Just Disability Resources (SJDR), and andragogical scaffolding to create inclusive, culturally responsive opportunities for learners to practice professional communication in authentic workplace contexts. Designed for delivery both in-person and online (dual-mode), the lesson embeds trauma-informed and growth-mindset strategies that normalize mistakes as opportunities for learning.

Approximate time: 90 minutes - adaptable for single or double class periods.

**Learning Outcomes**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Clarify Learning Goals - CAST, 2024)*
By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Identify three characteristics of effective professional communication (clarity, tone, active listening).
- Demonstrate communication strategies through structured role-play or digital simulation.
- Reflect on personal communication strengths and set one improvement goal for future workplace interactions.
**Rationale:** Communication proficiency is consistently ranked by employers as a leading factor in hiring and retention (Williams et al., 2023).

**Scenario-Based Hook**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Recruit Interest + Connect to Relevance)*

*“You start a new job at a community center. On your first day, a coworker gives instructions quickly, and you’re not sure what they said. How do you respond?”*

Learners brainstorm possible responses individually, then discuss options in pairs or breakout rooms. Facilitators highlight respectful clarification techniques and model curiosity over correction.

**Rationale:** Scenario-based learning builds emotional connection and promotes transfer of communication skills to authentic workplace contexts (RTI International, 2024; Stadd et al., 2023).

**Direct Instruction: Multiple Means of Representation**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Provide Options for Perception & Understanding)*

| Release | Learners independently role-play a new scenario or record a short digital interaction demonstrating communication strategies. | Optional scaffolds remain available (≈ 25 min). |

**Rationale:** Structured fading of supports fosters autonomy and confidence in communication (Montgomery et al., 2024).

**Student Reflection & Self-Advocacy**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Foster Self-Regulation)*

**Reflection prompts**:

- “How did you ensure your message was clear?”
- “What was challenging about listening or clarifying today?”
- “Describe one workplace or volunteer situation where you can apply today’s communication strategy.”
Learners set one personal communication goal for use in future teamwork or customer interactions.

**Rationale:** Embedding reflection builds self-awareness and self-advocacy, enhancing job retention and persistence (Burke et al., 2021).

**Assessment Options**

**How to Use This Template**

This module illustrates how to embed communication skill-building within UDL-aligned, scaffolded instruction. The structure authentic scenarios, multimodal delivery, faded supports, and reflective assessments can be adapted across programs or used to design micro-credential pathways in *Professional Communication* or *Customer Service Skills.*

By operationalizing inclusive design, this module fulfills the recommendations of Chapter 5 to integrate UDL + SJDR principles, trauma-informed strategies, and workforce competencies into scalable faculty practice consistent with Vision 2030 priorities (CCCCO, 2025).


# **Appendix B-2**

**Time Management & Task Completion Module****: Toolkit Lesson Template - UDL + SJDR Aligned**

**Introduction to the Module**

The Time Management & Task Completion module supports adult learners with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in strengthening executive-functioning skills essential for competitive employment. Employers consistently cite organization, punctuality, and follow-through as key indicators of workplace readiness, ranking these alongside communication and teamwork in hiring decisions (Williams et al., 2023).

Learners with IDD, ASD, or other cognitive differences may experience barriers such as difficulty prioritizing, organizing schedules, or sustaining attention under pressure (Burke et al., 2021). This module integrates Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Socially Just Disability Resources (SJDR), and scaffolded instruction to teach practical, workplace-aligned time-management strategies. Lessons are designed for dual-mode delivery (in-person and online) and embed trauma-informed, culturally responsive practices that reduce anxiety and promote agency.

**Approximate time**: 90 minutes - adaptable for single or double class periods.

In alignment with Vision 2030 goals-access, equity, and workforce mobility-this module prepares learners for stackable micro-credentials in *Organization & Productivity* and reinforces employability across pathways (CCCCO, 2025).

**Learning Outcomes**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Clarify Learning Goals - CAST, 2024)*

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Identify three strategies for organizing and completing workplace tasks.
- Apply scheduling and prioritization techniques using guided-practice tools.
- Reflect on personal time-management habits and set one goal for future employment scenarios.
**Rationale:** Employers rank time management and task completion among the top five soft skills influencing job retention and advancement (Williams et al., 2023).

**Scenario-Based Hook**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Recruit Interest + Connect to Relevance)*

*“Imagine you start a new job at a busy office. Your supervisor gives you three tasks to finish by the end of the day. How do you decide which one to start first? How will you ensure you finish on time?”*

Learners brainstorm in small groups or breakout rooms, sharing strategies for prioritization. Facilitators highlight varied approaches before moving into direct instruction. 
*Example: You have 15 minutes to plan your approach before the instructor checks in.*

**Rationale:** Authentic workplace dilemmas increase motivation and help adult learners transfer skills from classroom to employment (RTI International, 2024; Stadd et al., 2023).

**Direct Instruction: Multiple Means of Representation**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Provide Options for Perception & Understanding)*

# **Appendix B-3**

## **Teamwork & Conflict Resolution Module****: Toolkit Lesson Template - UDL Aligned**

**Introduction to the Module**

The Teamwork & Conflict Resolution module supports adult learners with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in building collaboration, empathy, and interpersonal communication skills essential for integrated employment. Employers consistently rate teamwork, adaptability, and relationship management among the most valued competencies (Williams et al., 2023).

This lesson is designed for courses where students practice interpersonal communication in applied workforce settings.

Learners with IDD or ASD may experience barriers such as differing communication styles, anxiety in group settings, or difficulty interpreting nonverbal cues (Burke et al., 2021). This module applies Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Socially Just Disability Resources (SJDR), and trauma-informed scaffolding to create psychologically safe, culturally responsive spaces for collaboration practice.

**Approximate time**: 90 minutes - adaptable for single or double class periods.

In alignment with Vision 2030 priorities access, equity, and workforce mobility this module advances institutional goals for equitable teamwork instruction and micro-credentials in *Collaboration & Conflict Resolution (CCCCO, 2025).*

**Learning Outcomes**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Clarify Learning Goals - CAST, 2024)*

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Describe three strategies for effective teamwork and respectful collaboration.
- Demonstrate conflict-resolution techniques through structured role-play and guided practice.
- Reflect on personal teamwork strengths and set one goal for future collaboration.
**Rationale:** Employers link teamwork and conflict-resolution competence to retention and advancement (Williams et al., 2023).

**Scenario-Based Hook**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Recruit Interest + Connect to Relevance)*

*“You’re assigned to a team project at your new job. Two coworkers disagree about how to complete the task, and everyone looks to you for input. How would you handle the situation?”*

Learners brainstorm possible responses individually, then discuss solutions in pairs or breakout rooms. Facilitators emphasize respectful listening, shared problem-solving, and compromise.
*Note*: Use a group-agreement reminder before discussion to reinforce respect and turn-taking.
You have 10 minutes to develop your response before teams share strategies.

**Rationale**: Authentic dilemmas strengthen relevance and promote emotional connection, increasing transfer to workplace contexts (RTI International, 2024; Stadd et al., 2023).

# **Appendix B-4**

## **Self-Advocacy & Goal Setting Module****: ****Toolkit Lesson Template - UDL Aligned**

**Introduction to the Module**

The Self-Advocacy & Goal Setting module empowers adult learners with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) to communicate their needs, set achievable goals, and take ownership of learning and employment pathways. Self-advocacy directly supports persistence, independence, and successful transitions to competitive employment (Burke et al., 2021; King, 2024).

This lesson is designed for noncredit and workforce preparation courses that help adult learners build the self-determination skills needed to transition into career technical education, certificate, or degree pathways.

This module may be delivered as a stand-alone workshop or embedded within a career-readiness sequence. Learners may face barriers such as reluctance to disclose needs, difficulty articulating goals, or limited prior experience with collaborative planning.

The module integrates Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Socially Just Disability Resources (SJDR), and the Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI) to create inclusive, scaffolded opportunities for voice, choice, and agency. Lessons are trauma-informed and culturally responsive, affirming identity while reducing anxiety around disclosure and decision-making.

**Approximate time**: 90 minutes - adaptable for single or double class periods.

Aligned with Vision 2030 priorities - access, equity, and workforce mobility - this module contributes to micro-credentials in *Self-Management & Advocacy* and supports institutional metrics for student success and retention (CCCCO, 2025).

**Learning Outcomes**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Clarify Learning Goals - CAST, 2024)*

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Define self-advocacy and identify at least two situations where it applies in school or work.
- Use a structured goal-setting framework (*Know → Plan → Speak Up*) to create a personal action plan.
- Communicate one support need or accommodation request respectfully and clearly.
**Rationale:** Explicit instruction in self-advocacy improves employment retention and quality of life for adults with IDD (Burke et al., 2021; Triana-Vera & López-Vargas, 2025).

**Scenario-Based Hook**

*(UDL Checkpoint: Recruit Interest + Connect to Relevance)*

*“You’ve been at your job for two weeks. Your supervisor changes your shift and forgets to update your transportation schedule. You’re not sure how to ask for help without upsetting anyone - what do you do?”*

Learners brainstorm individually, then discuss options in small groups.
Use a group-agreement reminder before sharing to reinforce safety and respect.
Notice how your body feels before responding; take a breath before choosing your next step.
*You have 10 minutes to plan your response before discussion.*

**Rationale:** Realistic advocacy scenarios increase engagement and normalize help-seeking behaviors (RTI International, 2024).

*Weekly Learner Reflection Sheet*

| Question | My Reflection / Notes |
| --- | --- |
| What went well this week? |  |
| What challenges did I face? |  |
| How did I solve or manage a problem? |  |
| What skills did I practice (communication, teamwork, time management, etc.)? |  |
| How did I feel about my learning this week? |  |
| What is one thing I will try differently next time? |  |

**Optional Faculty Prompt:** Encourage students to share one insight during class or a check-in discussion.

**Tool D-3. Soft-Skills Self-Assessment**

*(Adaptable for midterm or final reflection)*

**Table D3**

*Soft Skills Self-Assessment*

Rate yourself for each area:
1 = I am still learning  2 = I am improving  3 = I am confident

| Skill Area | 1 | 2 | 3 | Example or Evidence | Peer or Instructor Feedback (optional) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Communication | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |  |  |
| Teamwork | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |  |  |
| Time Management | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |  |  |
| Adaptability | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |  |  |
| Self-Advocacy | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |  |  |
| Professionalism | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |  |  |

**Reflection Questions:**

- Which skill improved the most this term?
- Which one would I like to strengthen next?
- What support or strategy would help me continue growing?
**Tool D-4. Visual Decision Organizer (Optional)**

*(Supports executive functioning, self-awareness, and problem-solving)*

**Table D4**

*Visual Decision Organizer*

**You can use words, symbols, or pictures - whatever helps you think.**

| Step | Question | Example Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Identify the problem | What is happening? | “I’m having trouble finishing assignments on time.” |
| 2. Explore options | What could I try? | “Ask for help, plan smaller tasks, set a timer.” |
| 3. Choose a solution | Which one seems best? | “Plan smaller tasks.” |
| 4. Test and reflect | What worked? What didn’t? | “The timer helped! I’ll keep using it.” |

**Alternative Formats:** Learners may draw, use icons/emojis, or type bullet points depending on accessibility needs.

**Notes for Use****:**

Instructors may select one tool per week, embed them in discussion or coaching sessions, or compile completed pages into a Workforce Readiness Portfolio for program documentation.

Using these tools regularly fosters learner autonomy, self-regulation, and reflection, core outcomes of UDL-aligned, equity-centered instruction.

- Tools may be completed digitally or printed for classroom use.
- Faculty may adapt prompts for different literacy levels or languages.
- Learners may include completed tools in a Workforce Readiness Portfolio for coaching or job-placement discussions.
- These resources model UDL principles by offering multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression.
- Collectively, they encourage learners to take ownership of their progress while connecting classroom practice to workforce readiness.
**Faculty Note: Connecting Reflection and Student Tools**

The student-centered tools in Appendix D complement the faculty reflection and fidelity materials in Appendix C by providing observable evidence of learner engagement, agency, and growth.

When instructors integrate these tools into their modules, completed learner worksheets and reflections can:

- Demonstrate the use of UDL-aligned practices (multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression).
- Provide authentic data for Program Fidelity Trackers and reflection logs - showing how inclusive strategies translate into learner outcomes.
- Support program review, accreditation, or grant reporting through concrete examples of inclusive, workforce-aligned instruction.
- Encourage shared reflection between learners and faculty, strengthening classroom relationships and modeling self-regulated learning.
