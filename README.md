# Inclusive Workforce Education Toolkit
**Transforming Adult Education: Practical Tools for Workforce Readiness and Inclusion**

This open educational resource (OER) is derived from the doctoral dissertation by **Alli M. Tucker-Stanojković, Ed.D.**, *Transforming Adult Education: Practical Tools for Workforce Readiness and Inclusion* (Northwestern State University of Louisiana, 2025).

## Purpose
This toolkit applies findings from a quantitative study examining how engagement in Universal Design for Learning (UDL)–aligned workforce readiness supports influences certificate attainment and job retention for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The study demonstrated that consistent, structured participation in UDL-based supports predicts certificate attainment and fosters persistence toward employment.

The Inclusive Workforce Education Toolkit translates this research into practical, replicable tools that help educators and institutions embed UDL, soft-skills development, and inclusive design principles into workforce education.

## Core Ideas
- **Bridge the education–employment gap** by integrating UDL principles into workforce training.  
- **Redefine engagement** beyond attendance metrics to include depth, quality, and contextual learning.  
- **Promote equity-centered design** through frameworks like Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Socially Just Disability Resources (SJDR).  
- **Empower educators** to intentionally embed self-advocacy, communication, and adaptability into instruction.  

## Contents
- **Lesson Plans:** UDL-aligned workforce readiness templates  
- **Planning Resources:** Faculty checklists, reflection forms, and coaching tools  
- **Appendices:** Practitioner resources from the dissertation Toolkit for Inclusive Workforce Education  
- **Research Basis:** Summaries of methods and key findings
